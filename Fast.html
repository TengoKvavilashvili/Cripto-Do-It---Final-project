            A major reason why vectorization is faster than its for loop counterpart is due to the underlying
            implementation of Numpy operations.

            As many of you know (if you’re familiar with Python),
            Python is a dynamically typed language. When you declare a variable,
            no datatype needs to be specified since Python will infer it for you during runtime.
            This is different from a statically typed language which requires datatype to be specified
            in order for the compiler to check,
            and these
            languages include Java and C.

            In Python, a list is assumed to store heterogeneous elements, and during runtime, each individual
            element in the list has to be checked (type check) when performing a certain operation. This will
            add certain overhead to a regular list. On the other hand, Numpy uses ndarray, which is multi-dimensional
            array of fixed-size items storing homogeneous elements. ndarray is optimized as the underlying operations
            are done using efficient C operations, which allows for vectorization.

            Another Example of Vectorization
            To let you understand vectorization better, another example is the popular loss function for Linear
            Regression — Mean Squared Error (MSE). Recall that MSE for Linear Regression is defined as the average
            squared error between the prediction and the actual labels in the dataset, and the prediction is the dot
            product of the current set of weights with the features. This can be implemented using vectorization as
            follows:
            Our Company relies on a high capacity MT4 Bridging Technology connecting the Meta Trader to our advanced
            Smart Order Routing and Aggregation engines, notably capable of processing up to 10,000 trades per seconds
            within the MT4 environment (i.e. we also support up to 50,000 trades per second within non-MT4
            environments).

            Our IT Infrastructure has been deployed within industry leading datacentres located in London (Equinix LD4)
            and New York (Equinix NY4) thus connecting our servers to those of the Major Exchanges and Liquidity
            Providers via fibre optic cables to bypass the Internet congestion.

            We at Our Company execute every single one of our clients' orders directly onto our extensive Liquidity Pool
            and at the speed of light, thus granted unconditional and anonymous access to the inter-banking market.
            Additionally, we protect our clients’ interests by granting them with full transparency both pre-trade (No
            Spread Mark-up) and post-trade (full Execution Reports presenting the name of the Liquidity Provider which
            filled their trade, how fast, at what price and at what time). That is how the MiFID Directive defines
            Transparency, and that is precisely how we believe any Retail Broker should implement it.

            Again we do not discriminate our clients by preventing them access to the inter-banking market rates; while
            the vast majority of Retail Brokers / Market Maker will do so (i.e. ECN/Pro accounts are not available for
            small deposits). Indeed, we execute all orders, including micro and mini lots, via our 100% DMA/STP Agency
            Only model for all accounts starting with a minimum deposit of USD 500.

            We present further below an execution report pulled out from a PRO/ECN Broker. This report demonstrates the
            undisputable superiority of our technology, as a 4 Lots order is filled here in about 5 seconds suffering
            from 4 rejects. Comparatively, with Keynote Brokers, our MT4 clients' orders are systematically matched in
            sub 0.01 seconds and verified as filled in sub 0.2 seconds (often in sub 0.05 seconds) with virtually no
            rejects.
